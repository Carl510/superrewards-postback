SuperRewards.com postback handling sample scripts for App and Game Publishers.
==============================================================================

Each time a user has completed an Offer or Direct Payment for your App or Game we will send your server a Postback. This Postback includes all of the information you need to award in-game currency to your user. These scripts will handle this Postback for you, and store the information in your database.

Choose a script which best suits your needs. 

Feel free to customize these scripts as needed.

These scripts will need to be placed on a web server accessible from the Internet. (Ex: http://www.example.com/app/postback.php)
